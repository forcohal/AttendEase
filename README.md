# AttendEase
The Smart Attendance System is a web-based app that automates attendance using geolocation. Teachers start attendance, and students mark presence with a single click. Data is securely stored in Firebase. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, it ensures a seamless, location-based attendance process for schools, colleges, and workplaces.
